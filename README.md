## Whatâ€™s the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. HTTPS is more secure than HTTP since it uses TLS (SSL) encryption for all HTTP requests and responses. Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is a protocol or set of communication rules for client-server communication. When you visit a website, your browser sends a HTTP request to the web server, which responds with an HTTP response. The web server and your browser exchange data as plaintext. Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is a more secure version or an extension of HTTP. In HTTPS, the browser and server establish a secure, encrypted connection before transferring data.

## IDS vs. IPS: Definitions, Comparisons & Why You Need Both
An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors traffic on your network, analyses that traffic for signatures matching known attacks, and when something suspicious happens, you're alerted. In the meantime, the traffic keeps flowing. 
An intrusion prevention system (IPS) also monitors traffic. But when something unusual happens, the traffic stops altogether until you investigate and decide to open the floodgates again.

You want to protect the assets on your server. But you don't want to slow down the traffic, even if a problem occurs. An intrusion detection system (IDS) could be the solution you've been looking for. 
You want to stop an attack as soon as it's discovered, even if that means closing down legitimate traffic for security concerns. An intrusion protection system (IPS) could be just right for you.
