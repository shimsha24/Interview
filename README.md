## Whatâ€™s the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is a protocol or set of communication rules for client-server communication. When you visit a website, your browser sends a HTTP request to the web server, which responds with an HTTP response. The web server and your browser exchange data as plaintext. hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is a more secure version or an extension of HTTP. In HTTPS, the browser and server establish a secure, encrypted connection before transferring data. HTTPS is more secure than HTTP since it uses TLS (SSL) encryption for all HTTP requests and responses.
